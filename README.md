Troubleshooting coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled in Android Gradle Builds
This note outlines common issues and solutions when configuring coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled in an Android project using Gradle. This feature allows you to use Java 8+ language APIs in apps that support older versions of Android.

The Problem
You might encounter errors such as:

Could not find method coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled() for arguments [true] on object of type com.android.build.gradle.internal.CompileOptions$AgpDecorated.
Could not find method isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled() for arguments [true] on extension 'android' of type com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.BaseAppModuleExtension.
General syntax errors if the option is misplaced or incorrectly formatted.
These errors typically indicate that the coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled flag is not being set correctly in your module-level build.gradle (for Groovy) or build.gradle.kts (for Kotlin DSL) file, usually located at android/app/build.gradle.

The Solution
Locate the Correct File: Open your app-level Gradle file: android/app/build.gradle.

Configure compileOptions:
The coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled flag must be set within the compileOptions block inside the android block.

For Groovy DSL (.gradle files):
The correct syntax is to call it as a method with true as an argument.

android {
    // ... other configurations
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 // Or your desired Java version (e.g., VERSION_17)
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 // Or your desired Java version (e.g., VERSION_17)

        // Enable core library desugaring
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    }
    // ... other configurations
}

groovy


In your case, your android/app/build.gradle was updated to this.

For Kotlin DSL (.gradle.kts files) (with Android Gradle Plugin 4.1+):
The syntax uses property assignment with isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled.

android {
    // ... other configurations
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 // Or your desired Java version
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 // Or your desired Java version

        // Enable core library desugaring
        isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
    }
    // ... other configurations
}

kotlin


Add the Desugaring Library Dependency:
You also need to add the desugar_jdk_libs dependency in the dependencies block of the same android/app/build.gradle file. The version of this library depends on your Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version.

dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:VERSION'
    // Example for AGP 7.4+ (your version was 2.0.4, which is fine)
    // coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.3'
}

groovy


Your project already had coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4', which is correct.

Key Takeaways from Our Troubleshooting:
Syntax Matters: The exact syntax (coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true vs. isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true) depends on whether you're using Groovy DSL or Kotlin DSL for your Gradle scripts.
Correct Placement: The option must be within android { compileOptions { ... } }.
Conflicting Tasks: We also resolved an earlier issue where a custom clean task in android/build.gradle.kts conflicted with the default clean task provided by Android plugins. This was fixed by removing the custom task definition.
By ensuring these configurations are correct, you should be able to successfully enable core library desugaring for your Android project.
